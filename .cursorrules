 Important: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom. 

  Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important. 

  Write better code.


  - When a fault, error, failure, or unexpected output is experienced:
  - Attempt a maximum of one fix at a time
  - Validate if that fix has resolved the issue
  - If that fix failed to resolve the issue, undo the fix, and reset the fix counter
  - Reevaluate the issue ensuring you make use of detailed line-by-line analysis
  - Continue to iterate on the above steps as required until the issue is resolved.
